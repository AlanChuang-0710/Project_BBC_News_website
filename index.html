                    <p>"The situation is just stuck," Kyrylo Budanov told the BBC in an interview. "It doesn't move."
                    </p>
                    <p>After Ukrainian troops recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November, most of the fiercest
                        battles have been around Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region. Elsewhere, Russian forces
                        appear to be on the defensive while winter has slowed down the pace of Ukraine's ground
                        operations across the 1,000km (620-mile) front line.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr Budanov said Russia was "now completely at a dead end" suffering very significant losses, and
                        he believed the Kremlin had decided to announce another mobilisation of conscripts. But, he
                        added, Ukrainian forces still lacked resources to move forward in multiple areas.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "We can't defeat them in all directions comprehensively. Neither can they," he said. "We're very
                        much looking forward to new weapons supplies, and to the arrival of more advanced weapons."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Earlier this month, after a series of Russian military setbacks, Ukrainian officials warned
                        about the possibility of another ground offensive by Moscow's forces from Belarus at the start
                        of 2023. The push, they said, could include a second attempt to seize the capital, Kyiv, and
                        involve tens of thousands of reservists being trained in Russia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mr Budanov, however, dismissed Russia's activities in Belarus, including the movement of
                        thousands of troops, as attempts to make Ukraine divert troops from the battlefields in the
                        south and east to the north.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recently, he said, a train loaded with Russian soldiers stopped in a location close to the
                        Belarus-Ukraine border and returned, several hours later, with everyone on board.

                    <p>
                        "They did it openly during the day, so that everyone would see it, even if [we] didn't want to,"
                        adding that he saw no real, imminent threat from the troops in Belarus. "As of now, I don't see
                        any signs of preparations for an invasion of Kyiv or northern areas from Belarus."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The interview in Mr Budanov's dimly lit office in Kyiv took place days after Russian President
                        Vladimir Putin travelled to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, for the first time in more than three
                        years. His visit raised speculation that he might try to persuade President Alexander
                        Lukashenko, a long-time ally, to send Belarusian troops to Ukraine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Belarus has been used by Russian forces as a launchpad for attacks, but Mr Budanov believes
                        Belarusian society will not support any further involvement in the war and analysts have
                        questioned the level of preparedness of its 48,000-strong army. "That's why President Lukashenko
                        is taking all steps to prevent a disaster for his country," he said.

                    <p>
                        The offensive, Mr Budanov said, was being led by the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary army. Its
                        founder, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, is believed to want to capture the town as a political prize, amid
                        rivalries between senior Russian officials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Away from the battlefields, Russia has carried out a relentless air campaign since mid-October,
                        targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with missiles and drones, leaving millions without
                        electricity, heating and water. Mr Budanov said the strikes were likely to continue, but
                        suggested Russia would not be able to sustain the level of the attacks because of dwindling
                        missile reserves, and the inability of Russian industry to replenish them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Iran has provided most of the drones used in Russia's attacks, the spy chief says it
                        has so far refused to deliver missiles to Russia, aware that Western countries are likely to
                        impose measures on Tehran, already under crippling sanctions because of its nuclear programme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The war may be deadlocked for now, but Mr Budanov is adamant that Ukraine will ultimately retake
                        all the territory now under occupation, including Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in
                        2014. He envisages Ukraine returning to its 1991 borders, when independence was declared with
                        the collapse of the Soviet Union.
